# python-api-challenge: What's the Weather Like?

## Background

This homework consisted of two parts: Part 1: `WeatherPy` (OpenWeatherMap API) and Part 2: `VacationPy` (Google Places API).

In part 1, we are supposed to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by utilizing the CitiPy library and the OpenWeatherMap API. Reuslting cities from this part will be used in part 2, where we use the weather data retrieved to plan an ideal vacation.

* The script was coded using Jupyter notebook. The libraries used were Pandas, Matplotlib, CitiPy, NumPy, SciPy, time, requests. APIs used were OpenWeatherMap and Google Places.

* All files are inside the folder named for each part `WeatherPy` and `VacationPy` respectively. Each folder contains:

    * A Jupyter notebook named after the challenge to run the analysis. The notebook also contains observations and insights that were made looking at the data (this is also below under *Analysis*).

    * A `config.py` file that contains the API key needed to make the API call. This is where you enter your keys in order for the notebook to run properly.

    * An `output_data` folder that contains the CSV file `cities.csv` created in part 1

    * An `Images` folder that contains PNG files of 4 scatter plots created in part 1, as well as 8 linear regression plots.
